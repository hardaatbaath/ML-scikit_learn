# ML-scikit_learn
This is my repository where I have explored various Machine Learning concepts using the Scikit-learn library. The code is an implementation of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDKCxebp88A) video of FreeCodeCamp and I am grateful to Mr [Aakash N S](https://aakashns.com/), CEO and co-founder of Jovian for this video, which has been an invaluable resource for me.
